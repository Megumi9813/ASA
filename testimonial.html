                    <span class="teaser">I would recommend ASA because it’s hard to find teachers who really love their teaching, and I could see Graeme is definitely one of them. I took a 6 months Hospitality Management program and I had the pleasure to have Graeme as my teacher. Amongst many other subjects I learnt about Canadian Culture at work and about the Hospitality Industry, retail, and more.</span>

                    <span class="complete">What I liked the most about Graeme is his ability to make any lesson dynamic. He has a good way to get his students motivated and make learning a great experience for them.  But my favourite part of learning from Graeme is how approachable he is, which gave me the confidence to give my best while learning, and at my new job, since I didn’t have experience working in a foreign country.  Thank you Graeme and ASA!</span>
