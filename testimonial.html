                    <div class="label center">Laura L (Chile)</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">I would recommend ASA because it’s hard to find teachers who really love their teaching, and I could see Graeme is definitely one of them. I took a 6 months Hospitality Management program and I had the pleasure to have Graeme as my teacher. Amongst many other subjects I learnt about Canadian Culture at work and about the Hospitality Industry, retail, and more.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">What I liked the most about Graeme is his ability to make any lesson dynamic. He has a good way to get his students motivated and make learning a great experience for them.  But my favourite part of learning from Graeme is how approachable he is, which gave me the confidence to give my best while learning, and at my new job, since I didn’t have experience working in a foreign country.  Thank you Graeme and ASA!</div>

                    <div class="label_description center">I'm so grateful that I could meet John and Tim in my English learning journey.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">John has the best pronunciation class ever! I never could've figured out how to say certain confusing words if I hadn't taken John's class. I also made great improvement in grammar and writing skills with John's help.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">Tim's class was always full of laughter. We learned lots of knowledge and vocabulary through conversations and games. In addition, Tim always encouraged us to share our opinions in class, regardless of our point of view.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">I'd highly recommend studying English with ASA. They have many excellent teachers teaching with all their heart.</div>

                    <div class="label_description center">Jacob is a skilled educator who is very passionate about passing his extensive knowledge and experience onto students and helping you make your impossible possible!</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">The way he teaches in class is very unique; taking his class leaves you with a breadth of knowledge you would never expect to have. There were lots of reading and discussions involved and the topics varied from history, politics, literature to current affairs.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">When we reach a certain level of linguistic ability, it becomes harder to push ourselves in order to attain the next level. Not only will he guide you to accomplish your further academic goals, but he knows how to maximize your intrinsic motivation which is crucial in the process of learning and simply amazing!</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">With the assistance of the exceptional teachers and programs here, you are on the right path to pursue whatever you aspire to achieve in the future.</div>

                    <div class="label center">Marcel K. (Germany)</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">The connection of literature to contemporary and historical events had a huge impact on my english improvement. Defending my points of view in a discussion helped me to improve my vocabulary and fluency. In the beginning of my studies, I wasn't able to express myself in the way I wanted to, but this lack of communicational possibilities decreased immensely by time and with each topic and discussion we had in the group.</div>

                    <div class="label_description center">I studied ESL and Hospitality with Graeme. He is the best ever teacher I have ever met here. He is a professional teacher and my English improved after studying with Graeme. He always gave me a lot of advice to help me improve.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">His classes were never boring, and Graeme was always well prepared with materials. And he knows how to teach English to international students. Everything was clear, and this is what the students always said when we talked about him.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">If someone needs a certain grade for college, university, or immigration, this is a huge opportunity. One-on-one, it will definitely help students. If I have a chance to study with Graeme again, I will do it for sure.</div>

                    <div class="label center">Alex S. (Germany)</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">Jacob's approach to teaching and his students is as unusual as it is successful. One could say: there is method to his madness.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">He is able to talk with you about philosophy, current politics and classical books like "Brave New World" or "1984"; all the time, he is keeping an eye on the parts of the English language that you need to improve most.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">The lessons are lively and diverse, yet focused. One homework may be about a course book's chapter, while the next homework is about a contemporary, recently seen, movie.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">I wrote book reports for "Animal Farm", "Brave New World" and "1984"; as well as, a movie review for "Once upon a Time in Hollywood". He was always able to help me understand some grammatical intricacies of the books better, as we discussed the contents of the different chapters.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">Additionally, we went into the details of an article in "Lapham’s Quarterly", talked, at length, about English grammar and discussed what it means to write at a higher level.</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">His teaching helped me reach a very high score on the Toefl iBt (116/120from an original ~100/120pts).</div>
                    <div class="label_description center">Since the course and opportunity he offers is hard to come by, I can highly recommend Jacob to anyone looking to improve their already decent English skills further.</div>
